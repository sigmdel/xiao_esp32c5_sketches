# 02_zigbee-on-off-light

The `Zigbee_On_Off_Light` directory contains basically a clone of the example sketch from the `esp32` Arduino core version 3.3.5 with slight adjustments to support the XIAO ESP32C5 and XIAO ESP32C6 boards.

A new Zigbee_On_Off_Light/[Readme](Zigbee_On_Off_Light/README.md) file contains details about the changes and also shows that the Zigbee_On_Off_Light end device can connect to a Zigbee2MQTT coordinator.
